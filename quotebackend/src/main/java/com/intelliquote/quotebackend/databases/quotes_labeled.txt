I have learned to hate all traitors, and there is no disease that I spit on more than treachery. - Aeschylu | O

Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death. - Anais Ni | C
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. - Anais Ni | N

Just remember, once you're over the hill you begin to pick up speed. - Arthur Schopenhaue | E
