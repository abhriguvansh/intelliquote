### How to Run the Back end
---
Technologies Required:

* Java 8

* Apache Maven

---
To begin running the backend, you must first install both dependencies.  

Then, navigating to the folder containing the **POM.XML** file, run:

```
mvn package
```

If you are using the Intellij IDE, simply clicking on the **POM.XML** file will prompt the ide to perform the download for you.

To start the backend, compile and run the **QuotebackendApplication.java** file.  This is the runner file for the project.  You can do this via any method of compiling and running a Java file.

If you do not get any error messages, you can then proceed to running the front end.
